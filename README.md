# "Be My Guest" challenge - Kaggle
Academic supervised learning (private) challenge. Scored 3rd place out of 79 participants, with an F1-Score of 0.94322.

Approach: made extensive use of random search algorithms to optimize hyperparameters for two models (after scoring far higher than all other model trials, with this data): Gradient Boosting and Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting, this last one yielding the highest F1-scores (the evaluation metric of the challenge).
